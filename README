Series of scripts to make multisite Drupal development on local machine easier.

These scripts will work on Ubuntu. Other distributions may need some modifications.

License:
========
None at all. Do whatever you want with this.

Warranty:
=========
Absolutely none! Zero. Zilch.
You are responsible for whatever you do!

Why Puppet?
===========
Because Puppet defines and maintains the state of your machine.
This way the scripts may be run many times over without breaking anything.
Why not Puppet modules then?: Because I'm lazy.

Scripts:
========
All scripts must unfortunatlly be run from their own directory. This is due to the fact that Puppet does not support relative paths.

install
-------
This will install LAMP+Drupal+Drush.
This script should only be required once in a life time.
Usage:
  sudo ./install -h
  sudo ./install -s<YourRootMySqlPwd>
After this http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ should work.

sites and sites.config
----------------------
Edit sites.config to include your sites and configure their source origin and which contributed modules they require.
Once done simply run:
  sudo ./sites
This script can be run over and over again.
