Series of scripts to make multi-install Drupal development on local machine easier.

These scripts will work on Ubuntu. Other distributions may need some modifications.

License:
========
None at all. Do whatever you want with this.

Warranty:
=========
Absolutely none! Zero. Zilch.
You are responsible for whatever you do!

Why Puppet?
===========
Because Puppet defines and maintains the state of your machine.
This way the scripts may be run many times over without breaking anything.
Why not Puppet modules then?: Because I'm lazy.

Scripts:
========
All scripts must unfortunatlly be run from their own directory. This is due to the fact that Puppet does not support relative paths.

install
-------
This will install LAMP+myPhpAdmin+Puppet and configure them.
This script should only be required once in a life time.
Usage:
  sudo ./install
Read and follow the prompts.
After this http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ should work.

mysite.pp
---------
Mysite.pp is a template to define your own site. Make a copy and edit to your liking. Also you should keep this file in your git.
Once done simply run:
  sudo FACTER_mysqlpwd=<bigsecret> puppet apply mysite.pp
This will ensure Drupal files and everything AND will INSTALL drupal. That's why MySql root's password is provided.
The installation will create database with the name of your site and the credentials will be <nameOfYourSite>/<autoGeneratedPassword>.
Drupal user admin/admin will also be created.

Once Drupal is installed, you can simply run the following over and over again:
  sudo puppet apply mysite.pp
